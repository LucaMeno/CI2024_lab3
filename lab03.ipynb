    "# Heuristics Used in the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is designed to operate using three primary heuristics, each serving to estimate the cost of reaching the goal state in a search problem. These heuristics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Manhattan Distance**: This measures the total distance each tile is from its goal position, calculated as the sum of horizontal and vertical moves required. It provides a straightforward and efficient way to gauge how \"far off\" the current state is.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tiles Out of Place**: This heuristic counts the number of tiles that are not in their correct positions. While simpler than the Manhattan distance, it can give a quick overview of the discrepancy between the current state and the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Linear Conflict**: This heuristic builds on the Manhattan distance by identifying pairs of tiles that are in the same row or column as their goal positions but are incorrectly ordered. Resolving such conflicts typically requires additional moves, making this a useful refinement for more accurate cost estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The A* and IDA* algorithms leverage these heuristics in two distinct ways, depending on whether the focus is on exploration or exploitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploration: During the exploratory phase, the algorithms prioritize broader searches through the state space. In this phase, a weighted sum of the Manhattan distance and the Tiles Out of Place heuristic is used. This combination provides a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, guiding the search towards promising regions without becoming overly specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploitation: In contrast, during the exploitation phase, the algorithms concentrate on refining and narrowing the search within the most promising paths. Here, a weighted sum of the Manhattan distance and the Linear Conflict heuristic is employed. This approach leverages the added precision of the Linear Conflict heuristic to resolve specific challenges and ensure the search progresses optimally toward the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adjusting the weights of the heuristics used in the A* and IDA* algorithms, the results may vary significantly."

    "# Main Function Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the program is determined by the value of the variable **AUTO**. Depending on whether **AUTO** is set to `true` or `false`, the algorithm follows two different approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When AUTO is True**:  \n",
    "   The program will automatically generate multiple puzzle boards of varying sizes (3x3, 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6) as specified in the code. For each board size, the algorithm performs a series of random swaps—between 800 and 1000 swaps—to scramble the board. Once scrambled, the algorithm attempts to solve each puzzle using the selected search strategy. This process is repeated for all board sizes, allowing the system to handle different puzzle complexities automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When AUTO is False**:  \n",
    "   In this case, the algorithm is designed to solve a specific, pre-defined puzzle. The puzzle matrix is hardcoded into the program, and the algorithm will attempt to find a solution based on that fixed input, rather than generating new puzzles. This option is typically used for testing or solving a known instance of the puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Algorithm Selection and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "For puzzles sized **3x3 to 5x5**, the **A\\* algorithm** will be used. These smaller puzzles do not require as much memory, and A* can efficiently solve them within reasonable time limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, starting from **6x6 puzzles**, the memory requirements for A* increase significantly, especially depending on the number of swaps applied to the initial configuration. Due to this, **IDA\\*** (Iterative Deepening A*) will be used for puzzles of size **6x6 and larger**. IDA* offers better memory management because it performs depth-limited searches, making it more suitable for handling larger, more complex puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it's important to note that **more swaps** applied to the initial puzzle state will increase the solving time. Therefore, for **6x6 puzzles and larger**, it is recommended to limit the number of random moves to a maximum of **500** to ensure the algorithm runs efficiently and within a reasonable time frame (about 1 hour)."
